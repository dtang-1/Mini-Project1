history

~
The history command keeps a list of all the other commands that have been run from that terminal session.
It allows you to replay or reuse those commands instead of retyping them.

The syntax for history is:
  $ history

The following is a example response the program returns:
  1  clear
  2  ls -al
  3  sudo dnf update -y
  4  history
1-4 represents the first 4 commands that was excuted in the session.
  
For example, if you wanted to prompt the command shell to rerun ine 3 of the history list, 
you would execute the following command:
  $ !3
